                        She is Alicia, my wife, a beautiful woman who always tries her best for the family. 
                        I have known her since 2010. Fourteen years ago, we met through a dating app. She was very lonely, and I was looking for my true love. I think people don’t know what their future holds, and for us, it has been a challenging journey. Now, we are far from home, together, trying to build a new path

                        He came into our lives unexpectedly, like a hurricane that shook us, but in the end, he helped us come together and form a family, becoming our driving force in life.
