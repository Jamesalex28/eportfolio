       My experience spans multiple fields, leveraging data analytics to drive efficiency and optimize
                        commercial strategies. I am proud of the impact I’ve had on each company I’ve worked with.
                        Additionally, I have enhanced my experience with programming skills. Now I can create a web page, manage Power BI, Tableau, Python, and SQL Server, which allows me to sharpen my analytical skills.
      </p>

	<p>
  I have hands-on experience analyzing and working with data to support decision-making. I can clean, organize, and explore datasets, apply statistical techniques, and interpret results to extract meaningful insights.
</p>

<p>
  I am proficient in building and evaluating predictive models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. I use performance metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R² to compare models and select the most effective approach for a given problem.
</p>

<p>
  I am comfortable working with data preprocessing, feature selection, correlation analysis, and data visualization. I focus on writing clear, efficient, and well-documented code, and on communicating results in a way that is understandable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
