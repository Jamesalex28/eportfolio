                    <h2>My Travel Adventures</h2>
                    <p>
                        Traveling is one of my greatest passions. I started traveling at the age of 21 when 
                        I went to New York for the Work & Travel USA program. That winter, I explored New York 
                        and then Puerto Rico. It was an amazing experience! With some friends I met during that winter, we visited the beaches and enjoyed the best restaurants in Puerto Rico.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My second travel it was in 2003 i went to Disney in Orlando and the Universal parks with my best friend Vanessa in that year.
                        We had some anecdotes first when we went to the parks where raining a lot so much of the attractions were close also when whe reserved a marriot chain during our stance the 
                        hotel just change of the name and tha rooms were stinky. At the end we had a lot of funny.

                    <p>
                        Through traveling, I’ve developed a deeper appreciation for the diversity of our world
                        and the beauty of connecting with different communities.

                    <p>
                        One of my most cherished travel experiences was hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu.
                        The breathtaking views and sense of accomplishment made it truly unforgettable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another memorable journey was exploring the bustling markets and ancient temples of Bangkok, Thailand.
                        The energy and culture of the city were mesmerizing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also loved my road trip through the United States, where I visited iconic landmarks
                        like the Grand Canyon, Yosemite National Park, and the vibrant streets of New Orleans.
